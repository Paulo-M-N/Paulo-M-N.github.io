### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part-1 was a section of the lab where me and my partner had to calculate the BMR of somebody who inputs their height, weight, and age. I enjoyed doing this program because although it might have been a bit challenging and tedious we still managed to use some skills we learned in math and computer science to make this program functional. I particularly like math so this program was enjoyable for me to make. We used a couple of things for the first time with this lab such as doubles but once we understood them it was fairly simple.

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7 had us make a program that told the user what time they are allowed to park on certain streets. I enjoyed doing this lab because we learned many new ways to code but one thing I particularly liked is how we incorporated using our programs in a way that ties more into the real world and everyday use. Everyone drives around and eventually has to park and making a program on what time you're allowed to park in certain streets felt more relatable and like this program could even be useful to me. 

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8 part-2 was a lab I enjoyed making because not only was it simple but also produced a very interesting output. For lab 8 part-2 we needed to make a pattern similar to the example given to us in the README. It was during this lab where I had a real interest in what kind of outputs could really be generated beyond just words, numbers, and sentences.
